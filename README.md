# Maximise-Profits-for-Ride-Hailing-Drivers
Taking long-term profit as the goal, I  propose a method based on reinforcement learning to optimize taxi driving strategies for profit maximization. This optimisation problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.
In this project, I have created the environment and an RL agent that learns to choose the best request,training the agent using vanilla Deep Q-learning (DQN).
